# Brainiac 5
This application allows the management and the retrieval of ideas in order to find ideas by similarity, sort them, create contents for presentation or reports. 
It contains two different services: 
- backend: a fastapi server managing data that run on port 8000
- frontend: a react.js interface to access the backend. 

# backend documentation
See [how to install and run backend](/backend/README.md)

# FRONTEND
## Install
```
npm run dev
```

# Deployment in production
## Configure your router and Pi
- Open firewall and forward port 80 (http) & 443 (https) on your router (look at your router documentation)
- Open your Raspberry Pi port 80 (http) & 443 (https):
```bash
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw reload
```


## Install and run nginx
nginx is use as a gateway to serve your website (both backend and frontend).
```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

Configure nginx to serve your application
- Create file */etc/nginx/sites-available/brainiac5* and paste the following code:
```bash
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name [your_public_ip_address];

    # 1. Front-end (React)
    location / {
        root /var/www/html/brainiac5;
        index index.html;
        try_files $uri /index.html;
    }

    # 2. Backend (FastAPI) via Proxy
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000/; # Redirect to local Gunicorn 
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```
  - Add symbolic link to unabled site
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/brainiac5 /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```
  - Restart nginx
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Install and run Gunicorn for FastAPI on your system (prod server)
Gunicorn is a production server that restarts by itself if something bad append. By creating a service, we also allow for Gunicorn to restart when your server restart.
 To go into production, use gunicorn.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/brainiac5.service
```
With file content:
```bash
[Unit]
Description=Gunicorn instance to serve Brainiac 5
After=network.target

[Service]
User=[your user]
WorkingDirectory=/home/[your user]/brainiac5
Environment="PATH=/home/[your user]/brainiac5/backend/venv/bin"
ExecStart=/home/[your user]/brainiac5/backend/venv/bin/gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app --bind 127.0.0.1:8000

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then restart the service
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart brainiac5.service
```

Allow the server to launch the service after reboot: 
```bash
sudo systemctl enable fastapi_app
```

## Use a domain name instead of a public IP
Go to OVH and: 
- Buy a domain name
- Configure the DNS: 
  - Go to Zone DNS
  - Select your domain
  - Change the 'A' type entries target by your public IP address. 

In your nginx configuration file, replace your **[your_public_ip_address]** by **[your_domain_name]**.

## Use certificates for HTTPS connection
> Warning: this is only feasible if you have a domain name and not a public IP address.

Install and run Certbot:
```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
sudo certbot --nginx -d [your_domain.com]
```
Skip email address settings...

Certbot rewrites your nginx configuration with the appropriate certificates.

Close http port:
```bash
sudo ufw delete allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw reload
```
